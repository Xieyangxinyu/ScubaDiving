# ScubaDiving

> The human brain is ingenious and mysterious, but every day we get a little closer to understanding it. Our research seeks to shed light on the furthest corners of our minds.
>Human beings, like many animals, mentally map their surroundings using specific neurons called “grid cells.” Each grid cell corresponds with a physical location and will fire when the person or animal is in that location. In a previous study, Dr. Zoltan Nadasdy investigated grid cell activity in people navigating a 2-dimensional environments by playing video games. Our current research investigates grid cell activity in a 3-dimensional virtual world.

<p>In this project, we build a virtual scubadiving experience using Unity 3D. The project has been tested to be compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. </p>
